# exit Function
The **exit** function, declared in the standard include file STDLIB.H, terminates a C++ program.  
  
 The value supplied as an argument to **exit** is returned to the operating system as the program's return code or exit code. By convention, a return code of zero means that the program completed successfully.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can use the constants `EXIT_FAILURE` and `EXIT_SUCCESS`, defined in STDLIB.H, to indicate success or failure of your program.  
  
 Issuing a `return` statement from the **main** function is equivalent to calling the **exit** function with the return value as its argument.  
  
 For more information, see [exit](../VS_visualcpp/exit--_Exit--_exit.md) in the *Run-Time Library Reference*.
